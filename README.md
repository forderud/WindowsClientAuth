Examples of how to use certificates for client authentication in web and TLS socket scenarios. The examples are geared towards Windows with trusted certificate storage, but all principles also apply to other operating systems.


## Getting started instructions

Prerequisites:
* Windows computer
* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) - for buiding the C++ and C# sample projects
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for Windows - for OpenSSL that's required for the Python projects
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) - to run the test web server

### Generate certificates for testing (optional)
Test certificates are already added to the `TestCertificates` folder. These can be re-generated by running `powershell .\GenerateCertificates.ps1` from the TestCertificates subfolder. Please note that this script will leave certificate "residue" in the "Current User\Personal" certificate store.


### Install root certificate (optional)
This step will remove the "Not secure" warning when testing from a web browser.


Install the root certificate:
* Either: From an admin command prompt: `certutil –addstore –f "root" TestRootCertificate.cer`
* Or: Double-click on `TestRootCertificate.cer`, select "Install Certificate", select "Local Machine" as store location, then "Trusted Root Certificate Authorities" as certificate store.

The root certificate will now show up in the Windows "Manage computer certificates" window:

### Install client certificate
This step will enable the web browser to use the client certificate for authentication against the server.

Install the client certificate:
* Either: From a command prompt: `certutil -user –importpfx ClientCert.pfx NoRoot,NoExport` (password "1234")
* Or: Double-click on `ClientCert.pfx`, select "Install Certificate", select "Current User" as store location, enable "Protect private key... (Non-exportable)", then install with default settings.
* Or: From the web browser "Manage certificates" menu: Import `ClientCert.pfx` into "Personal" certificate store with default settings.

The client certificate will now show up in the Windows "Manage user certificates" window:

It will also show up in the web browser certificate dialogs:

### TPM storage of private key
Installed certificates will by default have their private key managed by the SW-based "Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider" when importing non-exportable. It's also possible to store the private key in the TPM chip for enhanced HW-enforced security.

This should in principle by possible with `certutil -user -csp TPM -p "" -importpfx ClientCert.pfx NoExport`. However, that doesn't seem to work as expected, and instead leads to a `NTE_INVALID_PARAMETER` error. This appears to be a known issue, and one can use the [TPMImport](https://github.com/glueckkanja-pki/TPMImport) tool as work-around. The certificate can then be imported to the TPM with `TPMImport.exe -user -v ClientCert.pfx ""`.

One can verify the actual key storage with `certutil -user -store My ClientCert`. You'll then get `Provider = Microsoft Platform Crypto Provider` if the private key is actually stored in the TPM.


## Client authentication
The `clientAuth` OID (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2) EKU field in the client certificate enables it to be used for client authentication.
Double-click on `WebServer.py` to start the test web server to be used for testing of client authentication.

### Testing from web browser
Steps:
* Open https://localhost:443/ in a web browser.
* Select `ClientCert` in the certificate selection menu.

### Programmatic HTTP communication

| Language  | Secure certificate store support | HTTP API(s)           | Sample code              | Limitations |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| C++ Win32 | [CNG](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-portal) | [WinHTTP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/iwinhttprequest-interface), [WinINet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wininet/portal) & [MSXML6](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/msxml6/) | See [WebClientCpp](WebClientCpp/) | Unable to access certificates in ["Local Computer\Personal" store with MSXML6](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38779903/3267386). |
| C++/C# UWP| [CertificateStores](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.security.cryptography.certificates.certificatestores) | | See [WebClientUwp](WebClientUwp/) | Unable to access certificates in ["Local Computer\Personal" store](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/winrt-api/issues/2288) |
| C#/.Net   | [X509Store](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.security.cryptography.x509certificates.x509store) | | See [WebClientNet](WebClientNet/) | None discovered |
| Java      | [Leveraging Security in the Native Platform Using Java ..](https://www.oracle.com/technical-resources/articles/javase/security.html) | | Not yet tested | TBD |
| Python    |No known support (see [#10](../../issues/10)) | | See [WebClientPy](WebClientPy/) (file-based certificate handling)| [Unable to use certificate store for mTLS](https://github.com/sethmlarson/truststore/issues/78). _Might_ need to use [PyPAC](https://github.com/carsonyl/pypac) for PAC proxy support. |

All the language samples are command-line applications that tries to authenticate against `https://localhost:443/` using the client certificate. The applications can be run without any arguments and will output the following on success:
```
Client certificate: ClientCert

<html><head><title>Client certificate authentication test</title></head>
<body>
<p>Request path: /</p>
<p>Successfully validated <b>client certificate</b>: (commonName: ClientCert), issued by (commonName: TestRootCertificate).</p>
</body></html>
```

### Programmatic TLS socket communication
Client certificates can also be used for authentication when using "raw" TLS/SSL sockets directly. However, it's then important that the underlying socket library is based on [schannel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/performing-authentication-using-schannel) with Winsock underneath, and _not_ on OpenSSL. Direct [Winsock](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/secure-winsock-programming) usage _might_ also work, but that remain to be investigated.

The reason for OpenSSL _not_ being supported, is that OpenSSL is unable to access private keys through the [CNG](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-portal) API. There does exist a `openssl-cng-engine` project that seeks to address this gap, but [client autentication doesn't appear to be supported yet](https://github.com/rticommunity/openssl-cng-engine/issues/46).

## Proxy settings
The above API alternatives will automatically utilize Windows proxy settings.

#### Alternatives for configuring proxy settings
1. From the "Windows Settings" -> "Proxy" UI
1. Through [`Netsh winhttp set advproxy`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winhttp/netsh-exe-commands#set-advproxy) that was introduced in Windows 11
1. Through the WinINet API, which also works on Windows 10.

The [`ProxySettingsPerUser=0`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-ie-clientnetworkprotocolimplementation-hklmproxyserver) registry key can be configured to make proxy settings system-wide. This will have the side-effecto of making the Windowws proxy UI read-only, so that proxy changes needs to be done programatically from a process with admin privileges.

### Proxy configuration on Windows 11
System-wide proxy configuration:
```
echo { "Proxy":"", "ProxyBypass":"", "AutoconfigUrl":"https://mycompany.com/pac.pac", "AutoDetect":true} > proxy-settings.json
netsh winhttp set advproxy setting-scope=machine settings-file=proxy-settings.json
```

Show proxy settings: `netsh winhttp show advproxy`
```
Current WinHTTP advanced proxy settings:
{
        "ProxyIsEnabled":       false,
        "AutoConfigIsEnabled":  true,
        "AutoconfigUrl":        "https://mycompany.com/pac.pac",
        "AutoDetect":   true,
        "PerUserProxySettings": false
}
```

### Proxy configuration on Windows 10
There's unfortunately no inbuilt tool for programatic proxy configuration in Windows 10. However, there's a [Configure proxy settings for Azure Stack HCI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-local/manage/configure-proxy-settings) document that describes some of the underlying registry keys and points to a `WinInetProxy` script with sourcecode.

The `ProxyConfig` project is based on the WinInetProxy sample, and can be used to programatically configure proxy settings on Windows 10 machines. This project uses the WinINet [`InternetSetOption`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/wininet/nf-wininet-internetsetoptionw) function to configure `INTERNET_PER_CONN_PROXY_SERVER` & `INTERNET_PER_CONN_PROXY_BYPASS` or `INTERNET_PER_CONN_AUTOCONFIG_URL` settings for the current user. This is combined with the `ProxySettingsPerUser=0` registry key to migrate the settings to all users.

Exampe of how to configure AutoConfigURL for all users:
```
ProxyConfig.exe autoproxy https://mycompany.com/pac.pac
```

Exampe of how to configure proxy server and bypass list for all users:
```
ProxyConfig.exe setproxy proxy.mycompany.com:8080 *.mycompany.com
```

The system-wide proxy settings will be stored in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings` registry folder.

Note: `netsh winhttp set proxy` can unfortunately not be used for this, since it doesn't update proxy settings for the current user. It also lacks AutoConfigURL support.

### Proxy setting usage
Most SW (including  [.Net runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/main/src/libraries/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/SocketsHttpHandler/WinInetProxyHelper.cs) and [Chrome/Chromium](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/main/components/winhttp/proxy_configuration.cc)) appear to be using [WinHttpGetIEProxyConfigForCurrentUser](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winhttp/nf-winhttp-winhttpgetieproxyconfigforcurrentuser) together with [WinHttpGetProxyForUrl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winhttp/nf-winhttp-winhttpgetproxyforurl) to determine which proxy server to use for a given HTTP request. This simplifies networking code, since the application doesn't need to parse proxy settings directly. Python urllib documents that [proxy settings are automatically picked up from Windows registry](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.getproxies) without specifying the exact mechanism.


## Code signing
The `codeSigning` OID (1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3) EKU field in the client certificate enables it to be used for code signing.

How to sign a binary:
* From a developer command prompt, run `signtool sign /a <FileName>.exe`
